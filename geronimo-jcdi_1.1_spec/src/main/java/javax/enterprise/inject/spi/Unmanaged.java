/**
 * Helper class for manually maintaining CDI created instances

 *
 * Be aware that instances created that way are <i>not</i>
 * managed by the CDI container and thus need to be
 * cleaned up manually to not create memory leaks!.
 *
 * Normal code shall use {@link javax.enterprise.inject.Instance<T>} if possible.
 *
 * The reason for using UnmanagedInstance is for
 * &#064;Dependent scoped instances which should not pollute the
 * {@link javax.enterprise.context.spi.CreationalContext} of the containing instance.
 *
 * Note that the methods of UnmanagedInstance needs to be called
 * in a well defined order.
 *
 * Please note that this classes are not thread safe!
