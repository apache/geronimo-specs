/**
 * <p>An @#064;Dependent scoped Contextual instance shares it's lifecycle with
 * the Contextual Instance it got injected to.
 * &#064;Dependent scoped Contextual Instances also do <strong>not</strong> get
 * a normalscoping-proxy (Contextual Reference). They only get a proxy
 * if they are either intercepted or decorated.</p>
 *
 * <p>As of CDI-1.0 this is the default scope for any class if no other
 * scope is explicitly annotated. Since CDI-1.1 this is only the case if the
 * beans.xml has a {@code bean-discovery-mode="all"}</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Every CDI instance has an associated dependent context. Each dependent context
 * is destroyed with its parent webbeans component instance.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Please see <b>8.3 Dependent pseudo-scope</b> of the specification
 * for further information.
