/**
 * <p>The <code>CreationalContext</code> holds incomplete Bean instances and
 * references to all{@link javax.enterprise.context.Dependent} scoped
 * contextual instances injected into a {@link javax.enterprise.context.NormalScope}d
 * bean.</p>
 *
 * <p>E.g. consider we create a Contextual Instance of a
 * {@link javax.enterprise.context.SessionScoped} <code>UserInformation</code>
 * bean which has a dependent injection point
 * (e.g. a field <code>private &#064;Inject Helper helper;</code> )
 * In that case the CreationalContext of the <code>UserInformation</code> instance
 * will contain the information about the <code>helper</code> instance.
 * This is needed to properly destroy the <code>helper</code> once the
 * <code>UserInformation</code> gets destroyed. In our example this will
 * happen at the end of the Session.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><b>Attention:</b> If you create a {@link javax.enterprise.context.Dependent} instance
 * manually using
 * {@link javax.enterprise.inject.spi.BeanManager#getReference(javax.enterprise.inject.spi.Bean, java.lang.reflect.Type, CreationalContext)}
 * then you must store away the CreationalContext. You will need it for properly destroying the created instance
 * via {@link javax.enterprise.inject.spi.Bean#destroy(Object, CreationalContext)}.
 * This is <i>not</i> needed for {@link javax.enterprise.context.NormalScope}d beans as they
 * maintain their lifecycle themself!</p>
