 * Every context has a well-defined lifecycle. It means that

 * be passive. Moreover, each context is created and destroyed by the container
 * according to the timing requirements. For example, request context is started by every 
 * http request and destroyed at the end of the http response. According to the current thread,
 * active context is called an thread current context.
