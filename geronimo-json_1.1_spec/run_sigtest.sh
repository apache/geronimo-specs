# file to run the JPA signature tests


# HOWTO:
#
# Download sigtestdev.jar from https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/CodeTools/SigTest
# Copy to a local folder and set SIGTEST_HOME to it.


# not needed, we don't have deps to other specs in JPA
# mvn clean dependency:copy-dependencies

# generate the SIG for the RI
# there is currently no official jar yet. If availablen, then: curl  http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/javax/json/... > ./target/javax.json-1.1.jar
# java -jar ${SIGTEST_HOME}/lib/sigtestdev.jar Setup -classpath ${JAVA_HOME}/jre/lib/rt.jar:./target/javax.json-1.1.jar -Package javax.json  -FileName target/javax.json-1.1.sig -static

# this generates the signature for our own jpa api
java -jar ${SIGTEST_HOME}/lib/sigtestdev.jar Setup -classpath ${JAVA_HOME}/jre/lib/rt.jar:./target/geronimo-json_1.1_spec-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -Package javax.json  -FileName target/geronimo-json-api.sig -static

# then open the 2 generated sig files in a diff browser and the only difference should be some internal variables.
